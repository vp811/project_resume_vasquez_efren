            <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="me" />
            <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Florida Master's in Web Design and Online Communications. I started the program on May 2016 and look forward to having my degree come August 2017. In the first semester at the UF I learned the basics to HTML5 and CSS3. I was also introduced to the different programs that Adobe has to offer (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign). The purpose of this website is to showcase what I have learned so far during this program. My website will be evolving as each semester goes by. For the current Fall 2016 semester I learning more about HTML5 and CSS3 along with JavaScript and jQuery. Before attending the University of Florida for this Master's Degree, I attended Boise State University where I received an MBA. I am currently working for a business that sells mining equipment to countries in South and Central America. Once I am done with this program I hope to find a job as a front end web developer or graphic designer.</p>
