## Resources
* I used the boilerplate code provided to us in our lecture.
```css
.visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    white-space: nowrap; /* 1 */
}
```

* [Super Simple Text](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/jquery_super_simple_text_rotator_demo.html#) - Can be viewed in the interest section. The interest will scroll through the different words.

* [StickUp](https://lirancohen.github.io/stickUp/) - Can be viewed in the navigation. When scrolling down the Nav Bar will stick to the top.

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus

## Comments
